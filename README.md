# CarND-Path-Planning-Project
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

### Reflection
At first I just tried to get the car going and set a constant distance to 0.4m which will be driven every 0.2sec.
Now the car was going in a straight line.
Then I used Frenet coordinate transformations to follow the lane. One lane is 4m wide and I wanted to drive in the middle one which resulted in d=6.
Here you can see the highway map waypoints are widely spaced. When driving them linearly the ride is very jagged due to sharp corners.
The next step was to use spline.h interoplation to smoothen the driving path. Here I took only three widely spaced Frenet points which are 30m appart (s value). d is variable and used later on to change lanes. Interpolation with a spline made the planned path smooth and reduced pikes in acceleration and jerkvalues.
After solving this problem I realized the car was accelerating from 0 to almost 50mph in 0.2sec. To reduce jerk and acceleration in the beginning I set the reference velocity to 50mph. Any difference to the reference velocity is adjusted by a acceleration of ±5m/s². [main.cpp at line 472]
The velocity when driving the planned spline path is linearly approximated and adjusted by the spacing between the waypoints.
Now the car was able to follow one lane without violating the acceleration or jerk limits. However, the car is always driving at almost 50mph and would rear-end collide with slower cars. That's why I used the sensor fusion data to detect if a car is right in front of me. If so it would like to change lanes. [main.cpp at line 321] Changing to the left lane is always priorized. It will change lanes if there is no close car on the left. If there is already a near car on the left the same is done for the right side. If it's unsafe to take either lane the car will slow down and go slightly slower than the car in front. [main.cpp at line 311]

 otherwise the car would start slowing down and also try to see if it can change lanes. The sensor fusion data allowed the ego vehicle to see all the other traffic cars on the road, each traffic car's Frenet values were used to see if it was in the same lane as the car and then how close it was to the ego vehicle [main.cpp at line 324]. This logic using Frenet values was used both for detecting traffic car infront of the ego vehicle as well as seeing if a lane change was safe. If a lane change was safe the ego vehicle simply would change its lane and the spline interoplation would make the lane change smooth [main.cpp at line 342 and line 372]. 

The lane change logic was quite simple, if there was a car in front of the ego vehicle then it would see if it was safe to change to the left lane, if the left lane was not safe then it would try to change to the right lane. Some improvements could be made to this lane change algorithm by projecting further ahead and using a cost function to see if it really resulted in increased speed. Currently the car was able to go 4.32 miles around the highway without any incidents in 5:36. 
 
   
### Simulator.
You can download the Term3 Simulator which contains the Path Planning Project from the [releases tab (https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases).

### Goals
In this project your goal is to safely navigate around a virtual highway with other traffic that is driving +-10 MPH of the 50 MPH speed limit. You will be provided the car's localization and sensor fusion data, there is also a sparse map list of waypoints around the highway. The car should try to go as close as possible to the 50 MPH speed limit, which means passing slower traffic when possible, note that other cars will try to change lanes too. The car should avoid hitting other cars at all cost as well as driving inside of the marked road lanes at all times, unless going from one lane to another. The car should be able to make one complete loop around the 6946m highway. Since the car is trying to go 50 MPH, it should take a little over 5 minutes to complete 1 loop. Also the car should not experience total acceleration over 10 m/s^2 and jerk that is greater than 10 m/s^3.

#### The map of the highway is in data/highway_map.txt
Each waypoint in the list contains  [x,y,s,dx,dy] values. x and y are the waypoint's map coordinate position, the s value is the distance along the road to get to that waypoint in meters, the dx and dy values define the unit normal vector pointing outward of the highway loop.

The highway's waypoints loop around so the frenet s value, distance along the road, goes from 0 to 6945.554.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./path_planning`.

Here is the data provided from the Simulator to the C++ Program

#### Main car's localization Data (No Noise)

["x"] The car's x position in map coordinates

["y"] The car's y position in map coordinates

["s"] The car's s position in frenet coordinates

["d"] The car's d position in frenet coordinates

["yaw"] The car's yaw angle in the map

["speed"] The car's speed in MPH

#### Previous path data given to the Planner

//Note: Return the previous list but with processed points removed, can be a nice tool to show how far along
the path has processed since last time. 

["previous_path_x"] The previous list of x points previously given to the simulator

["previous_path_y"] The previous list of y points previously given to the simulator

#### Previous path's end s and d values 

["end_path_s"] The previous list's last point's frenet s value

["end_path_d"] The previous list's last point's frenet d value

#### Sensor Fusion Data, a list of all other car's attributes on the same side of the road. (No Noise)

["sensor_fusion"] A 2d vector of cars and then that car's [car's unique ID, car's x position in map coordinates, car's y position in map coordinates, car's x velocity in m/s, car's y velocity in m/s, car's s position in frenet coordinates, car's d position in frenet coordinates. 

## Details

1. The car uses a perfect controller and will visit every (x,y) point it recieves in the list every .02 seconds. The units for the (x,y) points are in meters and the spacing of the points determines the speed of the car. The vector going from a point to the next point in the list dictates the angle of the car. Acceleration both in the tangential and normal directions is measured along with the jerk, the rate of change of total Acceleration. The (x,y) point paths that the planner recieves should not have a total acceleration that goes over 10 m/s^2, also the jerk should not go over 50 m/s^3. (NOTE: As this is BETA, these requirements might change. Also currently jerk is over a .02 second interval, it would probably be better to average total acceleration over 1 second and measure jerk from that.

2. There will be some latency between the simulator running and the path planner returning a path, with optimized code usually its not very long maybe just 1-3 time steps. During this delay the simulator will continue using points that it was last given, because of this its a good idea to store the last points you have used so you can have a smooth transition. previous_path_x, and previous_path_y can be helpful for this transition since they show the last points given to the simulator controller with the processed points already removed. You would either return a path that extends this previous path or make sure to create a new path that has a smooth transition with this last path.

## Tips

A really helpful resource for doing this project and creating smooth trajectories was using http://kluge.in-chemnitz.de/opensource/spline/, the spline function is in a single hearder file is really easy to use.

keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!


## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
